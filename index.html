                <p>
                    Semantic HTML provides meaning to content structure, aiding accessibility for assistive technologies and enhancing search engine optimization.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    CSS specificity determines which style rules take precedence; it's based on selector weights and resolves conflicts.

            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="third" checked/>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    "let" is block-scoped, "const" is block-scoped and unchangeable, "var" is function-scoped and can be reassigned.
                </p>

            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="fourth" checked/>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Event bubbling is the order of event handling; event delegation uses a single parent handler for multiple child elements.

                <p>
                    Responsive design adapts to different device sizes using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.
